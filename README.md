# TTU-Thesis-Template-Unofficial
Unofficial thesis template for Texas Tech University master's and PhD thesis [LaTeX]

This repository is a derivative work of a (Dr, I presume) Robert E. Byerly.
His work was published on his univerisity webpage: https://www.math.ttu.edu/~rbyerly/

His contact information is not listed in the current faculty listings and the project has not been updated in a while. It is assumed he has abandoned the project, and for these reasons his original work is archived here for austerity. The pure representation of his work is noted in version history.

Modifications that follow are the results of previous beneficiaries of his efforts, my own, and the works of those whome benefitted after myself. They will be tracked as individual commits.
