A LaTeX thesis-dissertation style/template for Texas Tech
</h2>

<p> The Graduate School at Texas Tech has changed their <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/gradschool/current/THDGuidelines.php">
thesis and  dissertation formatting guidelines</a>. The current LaTeX
thesis style floating around the department was written in the mid 90s
and is out of date.  When I taught a course in LaTeX in 2007,
I decided to revise the thesis style to meet the
new guidelines.  It has since been successfully used to submit theses and dissertations by a number of people.

</p><p>  If you use this style, I would appreciate knowing about any issues you
encounter, as well as suggestions for improvement.

</p><p>
There are some user contributed notes at the end of this page.

Files needed
</h3>
You will need to download at least two files (see below). The first
file is a LaTeX documentclass file called <tt>ttuthes2007.cls</tt>.
The second file is the actual template  itself:
<tt>thesis_template.tex</tt>.  This document style uses two
LaTeX packages which you may or may not have:
<tt>fancyhdr.sty</tt> and <tt>setspace.sty</tt>.  If you are using
MiKTeX on a computer on which you have an administrator account, these
packages will be downloaded and installed automatically for you.
Otherwise, you may have to download them explicitly.

<h3 align="center">
Download instructions
</h3>

<p>Create a working folder for your thesis.  (Creating one on
your TechDrive is a good choice.)  Download the following files into
this folder. (You will probably have to right-click on each file.)
</p><ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~rbyerly/thesistemplate/ttuthes2007.cls">ttuthes2007.cls</a> (required!)
  </li><li> <a href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~rbyerly/thesistemplate/thesis_template.tex">thesis_template.tex</a> (required!)
  </li><li> <a href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~rbyerly/thesistemplate/fancyhdr.sty">fancyhdr.sty</a> (only required if you don't
  already have this package.)
  </li><li> <a href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~rbyerly/thesistemplate/setspace.sty">setspace.sty</a> (only required if you don't
  already have this package.)
</li></ul>

<h3 align="center">
Instructions
</h3>

<p> You may wish to rename <tt>thesis_template.tex</tt> to something
like <tt>mythesis.tex</tt>.  This will be the root file for your thesis.
Open this in your editor or TeXnicCenter and start writing.
<em>For best results, carefully follow the instructions given as comments.</em>

 I found how to correct the A4 sizing problem using MikTex.  I'm using the
TeXnicCenter front end and noticed that if I change something like the
\paperheight to 17.0in, LaTex would send the text off the end of the paper.  It
appeared that LaTex was working properly but the pages were ending up the A4
size.
 <br><br>
I'm using the compile method of LaTex=&gt;PS=&gt;PDF.  In TeXnicCenter, follow the
menu path of:  Build-&gt;Define Output Profiles  
 <br><br>
Next click the "Postprocessor" tab.  Under "Profiles" I have "LaTex=&gt;PS=&gt;PDF
selected.  In the adjacent box I have the following lines:
 <br>
DviPs (PDF)<br>
Ghostscript(ps2pdf)
 <br><br>
Click on the "Ghostscript(ps2pdf)" line.  For the scripts for "Arguments:"
change the <br>
 <br>
-sPAPERSIZE=a4    to  -sPAPERSIZE=letter
 
 <br><br>
I'm not sure why these arguments are set this way but they are.  It appears
that the last Ghostscript step was undoing all of the "Letter" sizing and
converting it to "A4".<br>
 <br>
Now I can go into Adobe, click:<br>
<br> 
File-&gt;Document Properties<br>
 <br>
...and it shows 8.50 in x 11.00 in<br>
 
Let me know if this is any help. <br>
 
Good Luck!<br>
